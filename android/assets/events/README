to make a new event, copy template.event as whaterver.event.

Put the title of the event between <title> and </title>

Put the main text body of the event between <text> and </text>

Put what the input options should stay in the <inputs> and </inputs> area, with
individual inputs inbetween <input id="n"> and </input> where n is the number of
the n-th possible response to the event.  This is also the number button that 
will be mapped to selecting that input on the keyboard.

Leave the top line alone, as that needs to remain that way for java to know
what it's about to parse is XML. 

You can edit these events with pretty much anything, however on linux, vim will do syntax highlighting. Notepad++ should do it for Windows too.
