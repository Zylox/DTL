THIS IS NOW DEPRECATED, user EventWriter.java in utils!


============DEPRECATED BELOW THIS LINE=====================================
to make a new event, copy template.event as whaterver.event.

Put the title of the event after "title":" and before ",

Put the main text body of the event after "text":" and before ",

Put what the input options should stay in the "inputs":[ and ] area, with
individual inputs inbetween begining with their number, ending with the string the user will click,
and a comma if followed by another input.  Currently there is an arbitrary number of inputs allowed,
though I am sure we will cap it at something reasonable.

You can edit these events with pretty much any text editor, however, an event writer will be made soon
